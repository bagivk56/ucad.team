    "Сообщение": "UCAD.T «Ural creative association of developers» is a young and proactive team of developers from the Urals (it's somewhere in Russia). We live in the same city and have been working together for over three years. During this time, we have learned to understand each other without words, interact in an agile environment and find non-obvious solutions, which allows us to give an accurate assessment of the project and meet the timings. We also have a rest together, sharing each other's hobbies, including a gym and bowling. We love teamwork, we love the development process, and we love seeing the results of our efforts (UCAD is good️). It is in this direction that we grow and develop!"
